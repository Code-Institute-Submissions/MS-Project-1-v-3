# Welcome to my first website!

This project was created for an imaginary after-school childcare service.


## User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals

The primary Project Goal is to create a marketing website for 'ActiveKids After-school club'.

The target audience are working parents who are looking for flexible after-school childcare arrangements that support parents' busy lifestyle and provide excellent after school care for primary school children offering a wide range of sport activities.

### User Stories

*   User stories
    * First Time Visitor Goals
        * As a First Time Visitor, I want to understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.
        * As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
        * As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily locate their contact information.

    * Returning Visitor Goals
        * As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have during and outside normal working hours.

    * Frequent User Goals
        * As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new services or activities offered.

### Design choices

* Colour Scheme
    * I decided to use shades of orange, blue-green and gray colours for my website because I find that these colours complement each other and are pleasing to the eye.

* Typography
    * The Roboto font is the main font used throughout the whole website. Roboto was chosen for its friendly features.
Merienda font is ideal for headlines.

* Imagery
    * Images were selected to support the project goal. The aim is to show children having fun and enjoying various activities (I feel that the home page is lacking an image. The website would have made stronger impact if Users were presented with an image supporting the project idea.

### Wireframes
